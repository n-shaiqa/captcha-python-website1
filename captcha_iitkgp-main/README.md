This repository provides you with a deployable model to solve captchas which contains characters with random alphanumeric character which has been strikethrough vertically and/or horizontally.

The tool to scrap these images from the website is also available on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cjwTIkQuU0ZUtSY8QKtg69gHR5PLnKLm?usp=sharing)

## How to use

### By Google Notebook

Make sure you have a Google account and are signed in to access and run the notebook.

1. Go to [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mafV7t0o0mPMyH1rObs60o3DNy8KDsUs?usp=sharing)

2. Add your folder path to [captchasolve](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mafV7t0o0mPMyH1rObs60o3DNy8KDsUs#scrollTo=gA_ikL1Z5tQv&line=4&uniqifier=1) function and get a list of strings with predicted texts.

3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to run and interact with the project.

### By using this repo

1. Download the zip file of the repo and extract it

#### Use the model provide directly

1. Add your captcha in [userset](./Data/userset/) directory present in [data](./Data/) Directory
2. Run the [model_using.py](./scripts/model_using.py) present in the [scripts](./scripts/) directory in your python compiler
3. Wait until the file has finished running, then the alphanumaric string after "For user provided captcha: " will be your output
<details>
<summary>Example</summary>
In output:

```python:
For user provided captcha:
1/1 [==============================] - 0s 30ms/step
['2DG53S']
```

Your ans is 2DG53S

Here the captcha was:

</details>

#### Train the model and then use it

(If you want to see/change the training data, u can do so by change the contents of [trainset](./data/trainset/) directory present in [data](./data/) Directory)

1. Run the [model_training.py](./scripts/model_training.py) present in the [scripts](./scripts/) directory in your python compiler
2. Then do the steps provieded for [Use the model provide directly](#use-the-model-provide-directly)

## Accuracy

You can test the accuracy by either using the [repos test dataset](#using-repos-test-dataset) or by [Notebooks](#using-notebooks)

### Using repos test dataset

Use the steps provieded for [Use the model provide directly](#use-the-model-provide-directly) but this time see the output after "For testdataset"

You can see/change the test data in the [testset](./data/testset/) directory present in [data](./data/) Directory

### Using notebooks
